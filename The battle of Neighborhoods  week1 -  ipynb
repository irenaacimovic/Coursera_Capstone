At the last census in 2010, San Diego's population was 1.307 million. San Diego has a population density of 4,003 people per square mile in the city proper. Starting out, it is difficult to know exactly who your target market is in San Diego, California. Even over time your ideal customers are subject to change. Therefore, it is important to evaluate your company and its products often to ensure your marketing campaigns are reaching the right people.\n\n#### Business Problem  is to analyse and select the best location in the city for our marketing campaigns targeted advertising is a way of placing ads based on demographics, on the consumers' previous buying history or on behavior. Many types of targeted advertising are used online, but advertisers use in other media as well. Examples of targeted advertising include having consumers choose which ads to view and placing ads on social networking sites and even billboards that vary depending on who is viewing them.\n"
